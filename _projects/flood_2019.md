In this work, we extended the work done on my Master thesis project. The paper on the project was published in ISPRS Annals and can be found here [Paper](https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/IV-2-W5/5/2019/). Our paper won the Best Paper Award at ISPRS Geospatial Week 2019 in Semantic Scene Analysis and 3D Reconstruction from Images and Images Sequences track. [Award](https://priyanka-chaudhary.github.io/files/ISPRS_GSW_Jun_2019_award.pdf). For our future work, we also want to move from fully-supervised task to weak supervision with learning to rank module. The motivation is to use the ordinal information of flood levels which is ignored when training with regression or classification task. Also, the weak supervision required to train a ranking network is a much simpler annotation task than pixel-wise annotation of images.
