Depth images are a rich source information about their subjects and have been found to be
particularly useful for tasks such as 3D Reconstruction. This work aims to learn a supervised 
pixel to pixel mapping from an RGB image to its corresponding depth image. The architecture in 
this work is based on the paper by Li, Jun, Reinhard Klein, and Angela Yao. "Learning fine-scaled
depth maps from single RGB images." arXiv preprint (2016)
