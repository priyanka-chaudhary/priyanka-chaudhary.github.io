Hi there! I am a PhD student and Scienctific Assistant at ETH Zürich in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing department[(PRS)](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch/). I joined the EcoVision Lab in 2018. I completed my Masters in Informatics from Technische Universität München in 2018. After doing her Master Thesis at EcoVision Lab on the topic Flood estimation through semantic image interpretation in 2017-2018, I am continuing my work on the project. The main goal of the project is to use images collected from social media of various flood events and use them to quantify flood. For quantification of floods, different objects of known dimensions which are partially submerged in flood water are used.

**BackGround**

I completed my Bachelors from Delhi Technological University (New Delhi) in 2013. Following that, I worked for two years in Samsung Research Institute as Software Development Engineer. I was respo

**Interests**

My *academic* interests mostly lie in inferring more about the physical world (and creating a model of the same) using machine 
learning architectures. Such a model has several applications - it can help answer pertinent questions regarding the causes of 
any phenomena that occur in their scope, help learn a policy that can output controls to drive the physical environment to a 
goal state that satisfies desired properties, or given a chain of previous observations, help predict what would happen next.

I am also interested in learning control policies for a dynamic environment that utilize intrinsic motivation techniques. This is 
especially useful when extrinsic rewards are sparse or unavailable for a given task (such as exploration).

Apart from the above, I enjoy doodling and have recently found a fondness for writing. I started with small stuff - like writing about
Her research interests are in the areas of computer vision, machine learning and natural language processing.
